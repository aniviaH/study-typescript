/** Objects vs Enums */

// In modern TypeScript, you may not need an enum when an object with /as const/ could suffice:

const enum EDirection {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
  A
}

const ODirection = {
  Up: 0,
  Down: 1,
  Left: 2,
  Right: 3,
} as const;

EDirection.Up;
          // (enum member) EDirection.Up = 0

ODirection.Up;
          // (property) Up: 0

// Using the enum as a parameter
function walk(dir: EDirection) {}

// It requires an extra line to pull out the values

type ODirectionValue = typeof ODirection[keyof typeof ODirection];
// type DirectionValue = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
function run(dir: ODirectionValue) {}

walk(EDirection.Left);
run(ODirection.Right)

function jump(dir: ODirectionValue) {

}
jump(EDirection.Down)
// jump(EDirection.A) // Argument of type 'EDirection.A' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ODirectionValue'.
