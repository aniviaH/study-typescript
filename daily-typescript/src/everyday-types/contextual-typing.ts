/**
 * Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations. 
 * When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it’s going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.
 */

// No type annotations here, but TypeScript can spot the bug
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
 
// Contextual typing for function
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});

// Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
names.forEach((s) => {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});

/**
 * Even though the parameter s didn’t have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the forEach function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type s will have.

This process is called contextual typing because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

Similar to the inference rules, you don’t need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it does happen can help you notice when type annotations aren’t needed. Later, we’ll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.
